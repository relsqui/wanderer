Wanderer
================

A pygame learning project. Single-file binaries available [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13951537/wanderer/binaries/wanderer-linux) (linux) and [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13951537/wanderer/binaries/wanderer-windows.exe) (windows).
(Mac soon! I just need to set up a dev environment for it.)

Controls:

 * **wasd**, **hjkl**, or **arrow keys** to move (hold **shift** to moonwalk)
 * **n** to create an NPC
 * **spacebar** to greet nearby NPCs, **c** to call out
 * **1** through **8** to change your sprite
 * **q** to quit
